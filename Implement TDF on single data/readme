A RGB image is converted to B/W image (3 channels to 1 channel)
We find the cropped likelihood(lh) and groundtruth(gt) of this converted image.

The Persistence Diagram is shown where the points are either fixed (mapped to (0,1)) or removed (mapped to diagonal)
The criritcal points for lh ang gt are saved inside TDFMain

On the actual image, these removed/fixed areas are shown
